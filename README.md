# Baby Shapes and Colors
Baby Shapes and Colors was created for my daughter as a way to entertain her when she was a baby. It allows the child to touch the iPad in a way that is relatively safe. The child can enjoy the actions caused by touches, which make the shapes move, animating in various ways. At the same time, various sounds, ranging from the voices of children saying “Hello” in 4 languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), as well as simple sounds, guitar chords, or music from Codea. The colors can be pastel or primary, outlined or plain.

## Installation
The following features might help you install this software:
- Written in Lua on Codea, Version 1.5?
- Exported to Xcode 6.3
- iPad app
- Deployment Target 7.1
- Numerous.framework libraries are included automatically by Codea.

## How to Use Baby Shapes and Colors
The app is designed for a baby to use, but some features are best adjusted by an adult:
- Launch the app
- Touch a shape
- Watch it move and listen to the sounds
- Repeat
- Touch the top right music notes button repeatedly to adjust the sound settings
- Touch the top left button from the settings page to adjust the color-style and appearance.

## Bugs
As of April 2016, only an older version is appearing on the App Store due to recent build issues.

When Xcode 7.3 tries to build it, it works fine on the Simulator, but fails for some unknown reason when trying to build on a real iPad. There may be missing libraries from Codea now. Furthermore, when re-exported on the latest version of Coda, 2.5, it stalls when building. 

Awaiting communication from Codea.
